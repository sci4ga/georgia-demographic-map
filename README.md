# georgia-demographic-map

We aim to use demographic, geographic, and other data to gauge public sentiment on science-adjacent social issues.

Completed Insights will be hosted on georgia-insights.org.

Science for Georgia invites anyone to contribute to the Georgia Insights project. To learn how to contribute please see the 'Contributing' section below.

## Interactive example

For an immediate, interactive example of working with the data set, click on the following link: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sci4ga/georgia-demographic-map/main?filepath=GettingStarted/Demo1.ipynb). It will take a few moments to set itself up, before providing you with a live, web-hosted Jupyter notebook based on this repo (no login required).
